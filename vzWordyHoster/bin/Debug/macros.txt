In Devil's Dictionary, the answers are only checked at the end of each letter's time-out period (unless the host chooses to check them manually before the time-out). If, at that point, anyone has correctly guessed the word, the round is closed.
Points will be awarded as follows://1st correct answer: 4 points//2nd correct answer: 3 points//3rd correct answer: 2 points//Any subsequent answers: 1 point
